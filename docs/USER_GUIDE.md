- Edit the image metadata to include relevant terms

#### Application Performance Issues

**Problem**: The application feels slow or unresponsive
**Solution**:
- Run database optimization
- Clear browser cache
- Ensure your device meets minimum requirements
- Consider splitting your collection into multiple databases

### Error Messages

#### "API Key Invalid"

Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly entered in the settings.

#### "Storage Limit Reached"

Free up space using the cleanup tools or increase your storage allocation in settings.
