# Vision AI - Completed Application

Vision AI is a cutting-edge image management tool powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 vision model. This application allows you to:

- Upload images in bulk for AI analysis
- Generate detailed metadata about image content
- Search through your image collection using natural language
- Keep all your data private and local

## Project Structure

The application follows a modern client-server architecture:

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- NPM 7.x or higher
- A Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. First, install the dependencies:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
npm install
```

2. Configure the application:

```bash
# Create .env file in the backend directory
cd backend
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env to add your Gemini API key
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
# Start backend server (from backend directory)
npm start

# In a separate terminal, start frontend dev server
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Performance Optimization

The application has been optimized for large image collections:

- Database indexing for fast searches
- Image compression for efficient storage
- Caching for improved response times
- Multithreaded processing for batch operations

## Credits

This application was created by Scout for the Vision AI project. It leverages:

- Google's Gemini 1.5 Vision API for image analysis
- React for the frontend UI
- Node.js and Express for the backend
- SQLite for local data storage

## Future Enhancements

While the application is feature-complete, potential future enhancements could include:

- Collaboration features for teams
- AI-powered image editing tools
- Integration with cloud storage services
- Mobile applications
